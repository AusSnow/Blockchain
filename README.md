# Blockchain
This is a functional blockchain application that allows the user to visually see the workings of a blockchain as the chain is extended or broken. Currently the program consists of a few forms that allows the user to input data or transactions and mine individual blocks. Every block has a block number, nonce, data, previous hash, and current hash. Using SHA256 we can compute the hash of all the data of each block including the hash of the former block. When a block is mined the nonce represents the attempts took to "mine" a block. For example, the current hash representing a mined block is to be prefixed with five zeros "00000" before continuing the random string of hexadecimal. By including a nonce we can add new data to the encrypted block until the value starts with these five zeros and adding the block to the chain.
